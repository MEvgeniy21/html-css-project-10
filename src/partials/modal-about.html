          About 70% of the ingredients in ice cream come from milk, although mixes often contain
          natural ingredients like sugar and fruit.

          Small quantities of stabilisers, flavours, colourings and emulsifiers may also be added to
          enhance flavour, texture or appearance.

          There are no added preservatives as ice cream is preserved naturally by freezing. As it
          freezes, the mixture is whipped and blended to give its smoothness.
